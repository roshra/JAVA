# Members of class

Group of Objects with common property
Blueprint from which Objects are created
Class in Java contains fields 
	Fields  	= Its like a data member/Instance variable 
		  	Its created instide the class but outside the method
		  	Doesnt get memory at compile time
		  	would get memory at run time only
		  	int x = 5;

	Methods 	= Its like a function
	Constructors 	= Defines what happens when object of class is created
			  Default constructor is new class_name()
	Blocks
	Nested Class and interfaces


# Default Constructor
mybox is just a variable at first - > Box mybox
with new Box() , the memory is initialized 

class Box
{

	double width;
	double height;
	double depth;

}

// Class =  Box
// New Object = mybox

Box mybox;
mybox = new Box();
Or 
Box mybox = new Box();

+--------+          +-----------+
|mybox   |          |width= 0.0 |
|        +--------->+           |

                    +-----------+
                    |depth=  0.0|
                    +-----------+


$ Java Class Atributes 
Concept is a class can have multiple attributes like 
age, first name and last name etc


# Static Method and Public Method
Static methods can be accessed by without an object 
Public methids can only be accessed by object
